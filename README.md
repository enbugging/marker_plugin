# Introduction

A small Chrome extension wrapped around the Marker python package, which was translated to Javascript. For the original Python source, see the repository Marker.

For lazy readers,

Marker is a Python module aiming for improving readability of text, in particular long and/or dense text and for audience with dyslexia condition. It is not designed to be an accurate highlighter, but to work fast and with streams of text, intended for further development.

The project combines several ideas, to which we owe my acknowledgement:

-   Bionic Reading, shared on LinkedIn by Mathis Grosjean,
-   Typoglycemia, now allegedly credited to Graham Rawlinson, who did his PhD. on the topic in 1976,
-   PositionRank, a keyword extraction method invented by Corina Florescu and Cornelia Caragea. (Florescu, C., & Caragea, C. (2017). A Position-Biased PageRank Algorithm for Keyphrase Extraction.
